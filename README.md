# Dynamic Gesture Recognition using a CNN  
  
A dynamic hand/arm gesture recognition system for robot control or interfacing, done as part of my honours research.  
I augmented the 20BN-Jester dataset with personally collected data. The Inception Convolutional Neural Network model was used & equipped with a Temporal Relation Network (TRN) module to recognise dynamic gestures over short time periods.  
The demo uses a webcam to detect gestures in a live video feed and includes a real-time graph showing prediction accuracy.
